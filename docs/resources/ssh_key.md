  This method creates an SSH key that can be used for Linux compute instance creation. An SSH key can be created in two ways: generated by emma or imported by the user.
  If you want to generate a key, specify two fields: name and key_type (RSA or ED25519). The key will be generated, and you will receive a private key in the response. The private key will be shown only once, so copy and save it to connect to the Linux compute instances.
  If you want to import an existing SSH key, specify two fields: name and key. In the key field, insert your public SSH key as a string. It will be imported.

# emma_ssh_key (Resource)

This method creates an SSH key that can be used for Linux compute instance creation. An SSH key can be created in two ways: generated by emma or imported by the user.

If you want to **generate** a key, specify two fields: name and key_type (RSA or ED25519). The key will be generated, and you will receive a private key in the response. The private key will be shown only once, so copy and save it to connect to the Linux compute instances.

If you want to **import** an existing SSH key, specify two fields: name and key. In the key field, insert your public SSH key as a string. It will be imported.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "emma_ssh_key" "ssh_key" {
  name     = "Example"
  key_type = "RSA"
}
```
